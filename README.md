# IUST Complex Network

### Assignment 3
1) Collect some networks
2) Compute some metrics of these networks
3) Analysis and discuss the results

### Assignment 4
Consider the three network datasets of assignment #3

1) Fit E-R, W-S, B-A, and X models to these networks
2) Select (find) X as the best fitting model
3) Generate artificial graphs similar to that networks
    * Specify the suitable generative parameters
4) Compute some macro-level metrics
    * Degree distribution, avg clustering coefficient, …
5) Compare the features of the real and artificial graph counterparts
6) Analyze the results (comparison)
